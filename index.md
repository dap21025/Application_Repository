My name is Daria Potapov. I am a senior at the University of Connecticut (UConn), majoring in Mechanical Engineering and graduating in the Spring of 2026. 

#About Me

I have had the priveledge of gaining hands-on, real world experience through an internship, and through UConn's Senior Design program. My experience thus far has focused on mechanical design, simulation, computer-aided design (CAD) and electrical circuit development. I've worked with a Civil Engineering company called Kimley-Horn as an intern, and I am currently working alongside the Naval Undersea Warfare Center for my senior design project.

My skills include:

Mechanical Design: SolidWorks, ANSYS, Abaqus
Programming: Python, MATLAB, Simulink
Manufacturing: CNC, Laser cutting, Sheet metal fabrication
Projects
Senior Design Project: Developed an eddy current sensor for turbo-machinery airfoil de-icing in collaboration with Pratt & Whitney.
Hybrid Electric Propulsion Tool: Created a tool for preliminary sizing of propulsion systems for a regional aerial mobility aircraft.
Production Tooling Design: Designed laser-cut and machined parts during my internship at Ebmpapst, improving production efficiency.
Feel free to explore my portfolio and reach out for collaboration or opportunities.
