Though I'm still in the very early stages of my Senior Design project, I thought I'd share some updates and thoughts here.

I just completed my first self-assessment for this project. Though these projects all seem like large undertakings, the course structure
demonstrates that even the most complex, daunting tasks can be broken down into smaller parts, which can be taken on one by one. Through
the assessment, I've realized that my group and I are in a very good spot in terms of the progress we've made - We have already 
spoken with our sponsor multiple times, met with our faculty advisor and have a weekly schedue set for internal meetings to ensure
we are on the same page at all times.

We have also developed a prototype that successfully demonstrates the first iteration of our design, and proves that it is operational,
compact, possible and attainable.
