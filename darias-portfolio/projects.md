## Projects

As an undergraduate at the University of Connecticut, I've had the priveledge to work with peers and sponsors on several 
fascinating projects, and I've also gained hands-on experience through my internship in the Summer of 2025.
### 1) Senior Design Project
###### Fall 2025 - Spring 2026
I am currently working alongside a team of Mechanical Engineering seniors, as well as the Naval Undersea Warfare Center, 
to develop a new underwater host, which includes a section which is capable of housing and deploying a 
small payload in an underwater/submerged environment.
Through this project, I am developing my skills in:
- Critical thinking & problem-solving
- Professional communication with peers, sponsors and experienced professionals in the field
- AutoCAD, ANSYS & Simulink
### 2) Fast Food Restaurant Drive-Thru Expansion
###### Summer 2025
During my Summer internship with Kimley-Horn, I gained hands-on experience through my work organizing land development,
utility, lighting and landscape plans for several fast food drive-thru site expansions, from one to two lanes. Though it seemed like a simple project,
there were a lot more considerations than it would seem would need to be made - for example, environmental/erosion impacts, utility interferences,
delivery and customer vehichle navigation, and materials science studies for products and pavers used.
Through this project, I have developed my skills in:
- AutoCAD and Bluebeam
- Civil drawing sheet-set development for client and contractor use
- Professional practices, communications and considerations
- Real-world negotiation and feedback reception
